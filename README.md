# BioCodec: Official Implementation

Official implementation for the paper "Neural Codecs as Biosignal Tokenizers".

We recommend a conda environment with ``Python >= 3.12`` :

```bash
conda create -n biocodec python=3.12
conda activate biocodec
```

Install the dependencies:

```bash
cd BioCodec
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You can run BioCodec on a random sample:

```bash
python -m biocodec.model
```
